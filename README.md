# Virtual Reality Logging Tool
An application that I developed for my 4th year project in college using the Unity game engine. The aim of this project was to develop a software tool to record user behaviour as they interact in a virtual environment. Data logs will be created during each session and the results from these sessions can be viewed by researchers and developers for further analysis.
